# Recipes
This directory contains all recipes.
Each recipe is treated as a repeatable system. clearly defined inputs, documented process, and room for refinement.
Recipes are organized by primary use case. (Breakfast, Dinner, etc.)

## How Recipes Are Structured

Each recipe lives in its own folder and contains:
- `README.md` → The recipe itself
- `Notes.md` → Observations and refinements
- `Version_History.md` → Iteration tracking

This ensures recipes remain:
- Easy to replicate  
- Easy to refine  
- Easy to automate
