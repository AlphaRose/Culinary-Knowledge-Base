  Recipes treated as systems: tested, refined, and documented with intention.

## Why This Repository Exists

Cooking, like engineering, is a system.

There are inputs.
There is process.
There are constraints.
There is iteration.
And there is reflection.

This repository is my structured archive of recipes, experiments, foundations, and refinements.
A place where food is treated with the same intentionality I bring to software and systems design.

I don’t want a scattered collection of screenshots, bookmarks, or half remembered adjustments scribbled in margins.  
I want clarity. Repeatability. Growth.

So I built this.

## Philosophy

I believe good systems endure.

In code, that means maintainability and structure.  
In academics, that means documented learning.  
In the kitchen, it means recipes that improve over time instead of living as half assed attempts.

This repository exists to:
- Preserve meaningful recipes  
- Document iteration and refinement  
- Capture what worked (and what didn’t)  
- Build a personal culinary reference that compounds over time  

Each recipe is treated as a living artifact; versioned, adjusted, and improved with experience.

Because cooking is not static.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Structured recipes organized by category  
- Foundational cooking references (pantry staples, flavor pairings, equipment)  
- Seasonal adaptations  
- Experiments and refinements  
- Notes on texture, balance, and timing  
- Version history when changes are made  

This is not a food blog.  
It’s not optimized for aesthetics.

It is optimized for clarity and growth.

## How to Use This Repository

Recipes are organized by category and designed to be:
- Easy to scan  
- Easy to replicate  
- Easy to refine  

When adjustments are made, they are documented.  
When something fails, it’s noted.  
When something becomes a staple, it earns its place.

## Long-Term Vision

Eventually, this repository will:

- Reflect seasonal cooking patterns  
- Integrate garden grown ingredients  
- Support meal planning  
- Capture family traditions  
- Track iteration like software versions
